;; Each function will pass positional arguments and possibly a map of query
;; args or a map that will get transformed into a JSON hash and sent as the
;; body of POST requests. The positional arguments are formatted into the
;; URL itself, where the URL has placed %s where it needs to have the args
;; placed. If the method is :put or :post, we generate JSON from query OR
;; if query is a map that contains a :raw key, we generate JSON from that.
;; This allows us to handle API calls that expect the body to not be a hash
;; but instead be some other JSON object. Doing this allows us to be
;; consistent in expecting a map.
;;
;; The query map can also contain an :auth key (that will be removed from the
;; map before it is used as query params or JSON data). This is either a
;; string like "username:password" or a vector like ["username" "password"].
;; Authentication is basic authentication.
